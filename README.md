To run this script, you'll need to download all three python files and have python installed. https://www.python.org/

all three python files must be in the same directory. Open your terminal and type python main.py
The script will then run

I've also uploaded discord_bot.py which will replace main.py if you wish to use this through discord instead of cli. you will need to create a discord bot through discord dev portal and enter the key into the last line of discord_bot.py
